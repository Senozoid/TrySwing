Before you stretched a cavernous hall, the ceiling so high that the light from the coldfire braziers did not reach it. On the other end was a small but ornate iron door, bolted, a violently twisted face carved on it.
In the center of the hall, buried halfway into the granite floor, was a sword. Precious gemstones were embedded in its gilden hilt, and its blade was radiant with divine power. There were strange markings in dark ink around the wound in the floor, through which the sword passed.
All around, you heard a low, rythmic thumping sound, like the sound of drums far away, or perhaps like the heartbeat of a titan in deep slumber.
